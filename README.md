# FlowState Okuru
This is the repository for the Flow State FPV drone racing simulator 


## Simulator Philosophy

This simulator is a true FPV Drone Racing simulator. The goal is to make it look and feel as similar to a standard racing drone as possible. As such, the goal is *not* to make the most HD/GoPro-esque visuals. Instead the focus is on simulating what pilots see through the goggles, static and all! Here are some of the founding principles of this sim for contributors' consideration. 
- Flight feel is #1 priority
  - This means lowest (realistic) possible input latency
  - Option for typical FPV aspect ratio, and resolutions
- Use as a practice tool
  - Lap times should be similar for most pilots/setups/tracks
  - Editable maps with commonly used track elements
- Visual disturbances similar to those found at an FPV racing event
  - realistic video static/interference
- Competitive
  - The sim does not provide significant advantages to those with high end gaming rigs
  - The "sim quads" could be flown "against" real quads, and yield a fair competition
- Field friendly
  - Should be usable with or without internet connection
  - Should function well on adequately powerful laptops


## Contributing

This project uses UPBGE as its game engine. If you would like to contribute, please follow these steps...
1. run ```git clone https://github.com/skyfpv/FlowState.git```, or download from GitHub webpage
2. Install UPBGE from https://github.com/UPBGE/blender
3. In order for you radio to work in the internal player, place a copy of gamecontrollerdb.txt in ```YOUR_UPBGE_FOLDER/2.79/datafiles/gamecontroller```
4. Open game.blend

## My Controller Doesn't work!!!
If under settings>controller you don't see stick movement from the radio you've connected, please follow this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDRx-TblE64&feature=youtu.be). Then create a github issue stating the controller or dongle you are trying to use, and the controller mapping text you got from AntiMicro. Please remember that if all else fails, you can connect your BetaFlight flight controller and reciever to the computer and use it as the joystick input as seen here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuobzowLfj0).
